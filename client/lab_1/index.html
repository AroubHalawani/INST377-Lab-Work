    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
    
    Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em>something in a line of text.</br><br>
    
    Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize somthing</strong> in the text.</br><br>
    
    Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></br><br>
    
    <h3>Empth Elements</h3>
    
    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</br>
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</br>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
    
    <h2>Images</h2> 
    Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
    
    <img alt="" src=""/>
    <img alt="" src=""/>
    <img alt="" src=""/>
    <img alt="" src=""/>
