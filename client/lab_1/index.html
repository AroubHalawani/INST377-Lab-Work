        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        
        Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em>something in a line of text.</br><br>
        
        Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize somthing</strong> in the text.</br><br>
        
        Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></br><br>
        
        <h2>Empth Elements</h2>
        
        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</br>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</br>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

        <h2>Images</h2> 
    
        Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.<br>
        
        <img alt="images 1" src="images/mochi.png"/>
        <img alt="images 2" src="images/mochi.jpg"/>
        <img alt="images 3" src="images/mochi.svg"/>
        <img alt="images 4" src="images/mochi.gif"/>
